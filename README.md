Generate EPUB books from HTML with simple API in Node.js.

------

This epub library will generate temp html and download images in your DOMs, then generate the epub book you want.

It's very fast, except the time to download images from the web.


## Usage

Install the lib and add it as a dependency (recommended), run on your project dir:

	npm install epub-gen --save

Then put this in your code:

```javascript
    const Epub = require("epub-gen");

    new Epub(option [, output]).promise.then(
        () => console.log("Ebook Generated Successfully!"),
	err => console.error("Failed to generate Ebook because of ", err)
    );
```

#### Options

- `title`:
    Title of the book
- `author`:
    Name of the author for the book, string or array, eg. `"Alice"` or `["Alice", "Bob"]`
- `publisher`:
    Publisher name (optional)
- `cover`:
    Book cover image (optional), File path (absolute path) or web url, eg. `"http://abc.com/book-cover.jpg"` or `"/User/Alice/images/book-cover.jpg"`
- `output`
    Out put path (absolute path), you can also path output as the second argument when use `new` , eg: `new Epub(options, output)`
- `version`:
    You can specify the version of the generated EPUB, `3` the latest version (http://idpf.org/epub/30) or `2` the previous version (http://idpf.org/epub/201, for better compatibility with older readers). If not specified, will fallback to `3`.
- `css`:
    If you really hate our css, you can pass css string to replace our default style. eg: `"body{background: #000}"`
- `fonts`:
    Array of (absolute) paths to custom fonts to include on the book so they can be used on custom css. Ex: if you configure the array to `fonts: ['/path/to/Merriweather.ttf']` you can use the following on the custom CSS:

    ```
    @font-face {
        font-family: "Merriweather";
        font-style: normal;
        font-weight: normal;
        src : url("./fonts/Merriweather.ttf");
    }
    ```

    Language of the book in 2 letters code (optional). If not specified, will fallback to `en`.
- `tocTitle`:
    Title of the table of contents. If not specified, will fallback to `Table Of Contents`.
